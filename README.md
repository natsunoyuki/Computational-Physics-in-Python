# Computational-Physics-in-Python
This repository contains a set of source code for various algorithms/tasks used commonly in physics, seismology and time series data analysis written by Natsume Yuki during his time at Nanyang Technological University and University of Tokyo.

Each file has its own in-built short explanation of the origins of the algorithm/equations.
